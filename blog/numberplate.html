            <h4>Abstract</h4><br>

            The Number Plate Recognition System presented in this project leverages computer
            vision techniques and optical character recognition (OCR) to detect and recognize
            number plates in real-time video streams. Implemented using Python and OpenCV,
            the system processes each frame of the video, identifies number plate regions using
            a pre-trained Haar cascade classifier, and extracts the alphanumeric characters
            using Tesseract OCR. The recognized plate numbers are then matched against a
            database of registered vehicles stored in MongoDB. Upon successful recognition,
            the system retrieves and displays associated vehicle information, such as owner
            name, make, model, and color, on the video frame. Additionally, recognized plates
            are logged into a historical database for further analysis and tracking.
            <br>
            The system also includes a web interface built with Flask, enabling functionalities
            like adding new vehicles to the database and viewing recognized plate records.
            Moreover, to ensure secure access, the system incorporates user authentication,
            requiring admin credentials for certain operations. Overall, the Number Plate
            Recognition System offers a robust solution for automatic vehicle identification,
            with potential applications in traffic management, law enforcement, and parking
            systems.

            Key components of the Number Plate Recognition System include a Haar cascade
            classifier for number plate detection, Tesseract OCR for character recognition, and
            MongoDB for storing and managing vehicle information. The system architecture
            is designed to facilitate real-time processing of video streams, ensuring prompt
            identification of vehicles as they pass through the monitored area. Additionally, a
            user-friendly web interface built with Flask framework allows for functionalities
            such as adding new vehicles to the database and viewing recognized plate records.
            <br><br>
            This project aims to address several challenges associated with Number plate
            recognition, including variations in plate appearance due to factors such as lighting
            conditions, viewing angle, and occlusions. Advanced image processing techniques
            are employed to enhance the robustness and accuracy of plate detection and
            character recognition, thereby improving the overall performance of the system.
            Furthermore, the integration of user authentication mechanisms ensures secure
            access to system functionalities, preventing unauthorized users from tampering
            with the database or system settings.

            <h4>Image Pre-Processing</h4><br>

            ▶ Edge Detection:
            Edge detection is indirectly utilized through the use of the pre-trained license
            plate detection cascade (plate_cascade). While the specific edge detection
            algorithm is not explicitly mentioned in the code, the detectMultiScale function
            of OpenCV's CascadeClassifier class detects objects based on edges in the input
            image. This method inherently involves edge detection techniques to identify
            regions of interest (license plates) based on edge features.
            <br><br>
            ▶Contour Tracing:
            Contour tracing is employed to highlight the boundaries of detected license
            plates. After detecting the regions of interest using the cascade classifier, the
            code draws rectangles around these regions, effectively outlining the contours of
            the license plates.
